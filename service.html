        <p>I enjoy organizing and participating in events which connect students from the broad robotics community with potential mentors in their field and events which inspire children and young adults to engage deeply with science and technology.</p> 
        <p>Below you will find some of the conference workshops I've co-organized on subjects like human-robot interaction, safety of learning-enabled autonomous systems, and career development. You will also find links to the fantastic outreach organizations I have been fourtunate enough to work with. </p>

        <p><em>Co-organizer</em>, RSS 2020</p>
        <p>When autonomous systems such as self-driving cars and robotic manipulators are deployed in real-world environments, it is of the utmost importance to consider---and ideally to guarantee---safe runtime operation. Since these systems often operate in highly uncertain and dynamic environments, it is crucial for them to model and quantify environmental uncertainty, understand its impact on system dynamics, predict the motion of other agents, and make safe, risk-aware decisions. Safety and robustness have been studied extensively from a theoretical perspective, and there are several prominent success stories in application, e.g. in aviation. However, techniques with strong theoretical safety properties have yet to penetrate many new and exciting robotic application areas, such as autonomous driving, in which uncertainty in environmental perception and prediction overwhelm traditional safety analysis.</p>

        <p>UC Berkeley AI4ALL gives high school students who are underrepresented in AI the opportunity to learn how to use AI to make a positive impact on their community while learning about career pathways in AI. Participants get hands-on experience with AI, hear from a diverse set of role models in AI on their work and research, and learn about how AI can be used to benefit society. After the camp, students will be invited to join the AI4ALL alumni community, Changemakers in AI, where they will have access to further support including mentorship, research and internship opportunities, and peer community.</p>
